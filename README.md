- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @chriscasGit
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m a nerd/Senior Data Analyst with +10 yrs experience that found its niche knowing much more IT/automation than your average business people, and way more business than your average IT people. Turns out being a generalist lets you get along/work well with a very diverse group people. Who'd say?
- I've always liked programming and was quite interested in exploring many topics since a teenager. So data analysis became my thing as allows me to combine both. Luckily it's so required nowadays so I get to do what I love and I get paid for it too. great, uh?
- I'm sharing this repository for my colleagues and myself in the future. Mainly projects I did at my job to save time to create more spare time to learn :-).
- There is much more code I can't share as would give away database structure from my work. So sadly I can only share that to internal people.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Machine learning applied to Supply Chain
