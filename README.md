- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @chriscasGit
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m a nerd/Senior Data Analyst with +10 yrs experience that found his niche knowing much more IT than your average business people, and way more business than your average IT people.
- I've always liked programming and was quite interested in exploring many topics. So data analysis became my thing as allows me to combine both. Luckily it's so required nowadays so I get to do what I love and I get paid for it too. great, uh?
- I'm sharing this repository for my colleagues and myself in the future. Mainly projects I did at my job to save time to create more spare time to learn :-).
- For the moment has python, scikit, vba for access and excel. I'll start adding more.
- There is much more code I can't share as would give away database structure from my work. So sadly I can only share that to internal people.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Machine learning applied to Supply Chain
